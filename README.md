# Final-Project-Advanced-Web-Applications

<h1>Name of project: Beer Me Up!</h1> 

<h2> Personal goal(s) </h2>
  
With this web application project, I wanted to explore front end concepts utilizing modern web programming languages, frameworks, and version control software like Git/GitHub. By creating a reasonably working web-application that has a clean and functional visual representation of a web-app, I could greatly increase my practical knowledge about the previously mentioned skills.

<h2>Code goal(s)/Ditto on SCOPE</h2>

Final project for advanced web applications. The idea of the project is to create a working beer stock management system.

<h2> Name of the technologies I used (Languages, Frameworks, Libraries, Programs, Other people's code)</h2>

Programming languages used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<h2>Some very valid considerations/improvements to be done during the development of the project</h2>

During the development of the project, I encountered the following considerations/improvements for a nearby future/next web development project:

1.	Improvements to a more fluid user experience with modern web framework.
2.	Fix some front-end spacing issues of user interface. 
3.	Add JavaScript code to input message boxes of success when I add new data.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

While working on this project and during Advanced Web Application course I learned crucial web development concepts such as:

- [x] Programming languages concepts , syntax and general logic.
- [X] User experience (UX).
- [X] How to create a creative and proper README.md file (canÂ´t deny it looks good and fun).
- [X] Overall lots of web developemnt knowledge that will be useful for my future carrer as an I.T professional. 

This was what I was capable of improving since the last version of the project. Above, the final screenshot of the app interface:
