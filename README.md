# Final Project Advanced Web Applications: Beer Me Up!

![CheersJosephDonovanGIF](https://github.com/fszpeiter/Final-Project-Advanced-Web-Applications/assets/39993307/c1f6cb93-a918-4927-b66f-e73379b54146)

<h2> Personal goal(s) </h2>
  
With this web application project, I wanted to explore front end concepts utilizing modern web programming languages, frameworks, and version control software like Git/GitHub. By creating a reasonably working web-application that has a clean and functional visual representation of a web-app, I could greatly increase my practical knowledge about the previously mentioned skills. I did not intend to tackle a lot regarding databases to be connected to this final app such I was focusing much more on the front-end side of things. But maybe try to connect both worlds of web development on a near future.

<h2>Code goal(s)/Ditto on SCOPE</h2>

Final project for advanced web applications. The idea of the project is to create a working beer stock management system named Beer Me Up! It´s a dynamic paged web application that has a hamburger menu for navigation and when the user inputs all the data about a particular beer, that beer is stored on a dynamic list on another page. 

<h2> Name of the technologies I used (Languages, Frameworks, Libraries, Programs, Other people's code)</h2>

Markup language used: HTML5

<h2>Some valid considerations/improvements during the development of the project</h2>

During the development of the project, I encountered the following considerations/improvements for a nearby future/next web development project:

1.	Further improvements to a more fluid user experience with modern web framework.
2.	Fixed some front-end issues of user interface (separate beer list page/cleaner overall).
3.  For a future project, maybe store the data utilizing a SQL database solution. I saved the data locally for this project.
4.  Some input data validation on HTML when dealing with the beer data input got me thinking/was a hassle. HTML only has input type 'number'. It doesn´t accept decimal number as input. I searched for something called regex but seemed kind of confusing to implement. Sticked with input type text unfortunately. Will catch up with the concept later...
5.  I was able to implement the buttons ‘Add Beer', 'Delete Last Added Beer' and 'Delete All Beers'. They´re all technically working but it would even greater if I was able to create a success message for each of the buttons. But they got a little buggy, for some reason.
6.  Wasn´t able to finish implementing a proper success popup message to the user when he presses the ‘Add Beer', 'Delete Last Added Beer' and 'Delete All Beers'. I got the ‘Add Beer' button to work with a message at some point but it bugged later on. Important point of learning for consideration.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

While working on this project and during Advanced Web Application course I learned crucial web development concepts such as:

- Programming languages concepts and syntax.
- Web development framework concepts and syntax.
- User experience (UX).
- How to create a creative and proper README.md file (can´t deny it looks good and fun).
- Overall lots of webs development knowledge that will be useful for my future career as an I.T professional.


This was what I could improve since the last version of the project. Above, the final screenshot of the app interface:

<p> Add Beers! page which you can add your beer data to your beer list (Located on the 'My beer list' which you access on the menu.) </p>

<p> My beer list! page which you can view all your added beer list information.</p>


***Thanks a lot for the valuable lessons and great academic term, Professor Marks. Hope to see you again/soon.***
