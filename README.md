# Final-Project-Advanced-Web-Applications
Final project for advanced web applications. The idea of the project is to create a working beer stock management system. I still haven't decided on a proper/more creative name for the application. 
Some improvements to be done:

1. Improve to a more fluid user experience with modern web framework.
2. Fix some front end spacing issues of user interface.
3. There is a small bug that is not returning the proper input text value. Will ask the professor.
4. Add javascript code to input message boxes of success when i add new data.
