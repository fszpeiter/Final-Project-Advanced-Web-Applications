# Final Project Advanced Web Applications: Beer Me Up!

![XxGIF](https://github.com/fszpeiter/Final-Project-Advanced-Web-Applications/assets/39993307/14e29151-5727-4e5f-ae32-1fb2277f52e8)



<h2> Personal goal(s) </h2>
  
With this web application project, I wanted to explore front end concepts utilizing modern web programming languages, frameworks, and version control software like Git/GitHub. By creating a reasonably working web-application that has a clean and functional visual representation of a web-app, I could greatly increase my practical knowledge about the previously mentioned skills. I did not intend to tackle a lot regarding databases to be connected to this final app such I was focusing much more on the front-end side of things. But maybe try to connect both worlds of web development on a near future.

<h2>Code goal(s)/Ditto on SCOPE</h2>

Final project for advanced web applications. The idea of the project is to create a working beer stock management system. ItÂ´s a dynamic paged web application that has a hamburger menu for navigation and when the user inputs all the data about a particular beer, that beer is stored on a dynamic list. Also, when the beer is added to the list by clicking on the 'Add beer' button, the application has a confirmation pop up box that confirms that the informed beer has been stored on the beer list.

<h2> Name of the technologies I used (Languages, Frameworks, Libraries, Programs, Other people's code)</h2>

Programming languages used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<h2>Some valid considerations/improvements during the development of the project</h2>

During the development of the project, I encountered the following considerations/improvements for a nearby future/next web development project:

1.	Further improvements to a more fluid user experience with modern web framework.
2.	Fix some front-end spacing issues of user interface. 
3.  For a future project, maybe store the data utilizing a SQL database solution. 

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

While working on this project and during Advanced Web Application course I learned crucial web development concepts such as:

- Programming languages concepts and syntax.
- Web development framework concepts and syntax.
- User experience (UX).
- How to create a creative and proper README.md file (canÂ´t deny it looks good and fun).
- Overall lots of webs development knowledge that will be useful for my future career as an I.T professional. 

This was what I could improve since the last version of the project. Above, the final screenshot of the app interface:
