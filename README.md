# Final-Project-Advanced-Web-Applications
Final project for advanced web applications. The idea of the project is to create a working simple beer stock management system. I still haven't decided a proper/more creative name for the application. 
Some issues/improvements to be done:

1. Improve to a more fluid user experience with modern web framework.
2. There is a small bug that is not returning the proper input text value. Will ask the professor.
3. Add javascript code to input message boxes of sucess when i add new data.
